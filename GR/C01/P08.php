<h3>1.8 Time Dilation</h3>
A reference O' moves from O with speed v.
Then the time of O' as seen from O moves slower. <br>
However, you could just as easy say that O moves away from O' and therefore the time of O (as seen by O') moves slower!<br>
So, what is it?

The core of the argument lies in what an observer defines as simultaneous.
All Obersvers agree about simultaneous events if they are right next to it. But if the event is a t a distance and one observer is moving relative to the other, 
both observer do not agree any more, what events are simultaneous.<br>
Consider the folling picture: 
<img src="Pic01.jpg" alt="Time Dilation" height="600" width="900">
O and O' are at the same event "A" (x=0,t=0). O' would say x'=0.t'=0.<br>
O' moves with considerable speed away from O. Therefore, the reference system O' are skewed towards the diagonal.<br>
Event "B" happens, once O' reaches 1 m distance.<br>
Since "B" lies on the hyperbola "E-B", O' measures 1m of time has passed (his/her proper time).
O on the other hand compares with his clock at a distance of 1 m and measures about 1.41 meters of time (line "D-B")<br>
Now O' look at O from event "B". For him/her his line of simultaneity is "F-B", so he measures O to be considerably earlier than 1m of time, namely 1/1.41. 
Therefore, for O' the clocks of O move slower as well.

When you look at your neighbor from afar, he/she looks smaller. When he/she looks at you, you look smaller. 
So, who of you are actually smaller? You have no problem with this, because you are so used to it!

<h3>General Relativity</h3>
I create this documentation for my enjoyment in my 4th or 5th attempt to finally understand some concepts of general relativity.

This documentation is based on the book:<br>
A first Course in General Relativity<br>
by Bernard Schutz
<br>(a present from my wife)<br><br>

The equations are edited using MathJax.<br>
A nice webbased editor can be found at:<br>
<a href="http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php">Math Tex Editor</a><br>
(In order for MathJax to work you have to copy the latex string into a pair of "$$". 
As well the javascript loading requires to put the reference to the MathJax library into the file itself)

<h3>1.3 Natural Units</h3>
Since special relativity combines space and time it will be much easier to use natural units.
This means to use the same unit for time as for space, the meter.<br><br>
<strong>1 meter is the time that light needs to pass 1 meter in vacuum!</strong>
$$ 1 meter = \frac{1}{3 * 10^{8} } seconds \tag{1.3.1}$$
With this the speed of light will be 1 (without any dimension)
$$ c = 1 \tag{1.3.2} $$
<br><br>
(Note) Although it seems strange to measure time in meters, most people are used to measure large distances in "Lightyears".
Think about it!
<br><br>
This leads to many simplifications:
<ul>
    <li>Energy is measured in Kilograms</li>    
    <li>Momentum is measured in Kilograms</li>
    <li>Speed is measured as fraction of the speed of light (with no units)</li>
</ul>
Let's play a little bit in the exercises with these untis.

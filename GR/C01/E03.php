<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
3 Draw the t and x axes of the spacetime coordinates of an observer O and then draw:<br>
(a) The world line of O’s clock at x = 1 m.<br>
(b) The world line of a particle moving with velocity dx/dt = 0.1, and which is at
x = 0.5 m when t = 0.<br>
(c) The  ̄t and x axes of an observer O who moves with velocity v = 0.5 in the positive
x direction relative to O and whose origin ( ̄t=  ̄x= 0) coincides with that of O.<br>
(d) The locus of events whose interval s2 from the origin is −1 m2<br>
(e) The locus of events whose interval s2 from the origin is +1 m2 .<br>
(f) The calibration ticks at one meter intervals along the x and  ̄ axes.<br>
(g) The locus of events whose interval s2 from the origin is 0.<br>
(h) The locus of events, all of which occur at the time t = 2 m (simultaneous as seen
by O).<br>

(i) The locus of events, all of which occur at the time  ̄ = 2 m (simultaneous as seenby O).<br>
(j) The event which occurs at  ̄ = 0 and x = 0.5 m.

 ̄<br>
(k) The locus of events x = 1 m.<br>
 ̄
(l) The world line of a photon which is emitted from the event t = −1 m, x = 0, trav-
els in the negative x direction, is reflected when it encounters a mirror located at
x = −1 m, and is absorbed when it encounters a detector located at x = 0.75 m.<br>
